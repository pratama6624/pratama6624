### 👋 Hello, I’m Pratama!

I'm a **dedicated iOS Developer** passionate about crafting smooth and modern experiences within the **Apple ecosystem**.  
I specialize in building iOS apps using **Swift** and **SwiftUI**, and I’m currently leveling up my skills in **backend development with Vapor**, exploring **AI-powered integrations**, and diving into the world of **IoT**.

### What I Enjoy Building
- iOS apps with **clean SwiftUI design** and **MVVM architecture**
- AI/ML-powered features using **Create ML** & **Core ML**
- Swift backend API with **Vapor**, seamlessly integrated with iOS apps
- IoT projects blending **hardware logic** and **smart software**

Improving as a **full-stack Apple Developer**, mastering the entire flow from **frontend SwiftUI** to **backend Vapor**, while keeping an eye on how **AI** can enhance user experience across all platforms.
